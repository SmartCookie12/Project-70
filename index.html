      <p class="text-muted">From 1998 to 2023, the school cafeteria has served millions of students,
      tolerated their messes and accidents, and gave them a place to talk and laugh. First opened on
      the school's first mid year festival, the beautiful cafeteria had shone and sparkle, and served
      healthy meals for hungry students after their lessons. But after surviving over 20 years of students
      in 2018, the place needed cleaning up. But with the help of the student council, and the clean up crew,
      the school was able to make the cafeteria prettier than it's ever been.

      <p class="text-muted">In the wonderful school auditorium, we host competitions, debates, and assemblies.
      We also perform class plays there in winter and spring, and we also watch fun movies there on school
      movie night. A few years ago, a tragedy happened in our auditorium. There was a fire, a small one, but
      big enough to destroy half of the place. But this year, we have a newly reinnovated auditorium, that is
      more wonderful than ever!

      for both students and teacher. A calm place for kids to relax and learn, and a peaceful place
      for teachers to plan their lesson plans. Each grade has a special day to visit the library, pick
      books, and listen to a story read by the librarian.

      Andrew Brown and Jessica Drew. But at the end, talented Andrew Brown took the gold. The topic was
      about pollution. Andrew was talking about how we should use metal bottles instead of plastic, while
      Jessica Drew was siding with plastic bottles.

          by the judges to win a scholarship in a special science club for smart kids. Congratulations,
          Riley! She will now represent our school in STR SciClub. Yay!
